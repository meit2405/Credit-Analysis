# Credit-Analysis
This repository implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Algorithms to predict credit risk based on customer data. It includes preprocessing steps like handling missing values, one-hot encoding, scaling features, and sampling datasets.
The project evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices, and visualizes results for actionable insights in financial decision-making.
